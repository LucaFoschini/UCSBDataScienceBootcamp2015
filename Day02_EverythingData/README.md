# Goals

- Learn about data science
- Learn how perform basic data manipulation with python
- See all the things that python can do

## Before you Begin
  - Commit your code locally
  - do a ```git pull```
  - Load up on positive attitude! We're all learning here :)

## Intro
 
  - Why are we where today?
```
IGERT ⊂ network science ⊂ data science.
```
  - Recap of using shell, git, notebooks see: [here](../setup.md)
  - Data science, [what is it](..//Day02_EverythingData/notebooks/01%20-%20Data%20Science.ipynb)? Why is it [The Sexiest Job of the Century?](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/)
  - Don't try this at home (I haven't either! --- Quick demo)

## Data Wrangling and Exploration

  - Python [basics](../Day02_EverythingData/notebooks/02%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Python.ipynb)
  - All Python [can do](..//Day02_EverythingData/notebooks/03%20-%20Libraries%20and%20Integration.ipynb)!
  - Numpy and Pandas (the missing library for [data manipulation](..//Day02_EverythingData/notebooks/04%20-%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)
  - Speed [considerations](..//Day02_EverythingData/notebooks/05%20-%20Theory%20and%20Practice.ipynb)

## Data Exploration

  - Work with text, networks, time series. Import your dataset into python, and start playing with it.
  - [Interesting notebook gallery](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks#introductory-tutorials). Pick one!
