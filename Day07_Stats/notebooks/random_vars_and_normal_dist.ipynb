    "Although we can never be certain what value random variable can take on, we often know or can guess what's called a <font color='red'>probability distribution function</font> or <font color='red'>PDF</font> for short. PDF's tell you what the probability is that a random variable will take on a certain value. In other words they tell you the probability of an event going down a certain way. If the event you're concerned with is the completion of a thesis and the random variable is number of years it takes, then the PDF could tell you that taking 4.5 years has a probability of 0.4, 5 years has a probability of 0.3, 10 years has a probability of 0.05, etc. If you integrate PDFs over all values that a random variable can take the result will always be one. This makes sense because the sum of the probabilities of all possibilities has to be one i.e. one of the possibilities has to take place"

This small detail is unimportant to know for this presentation, but is just a heads up for when you go out and read papers."
