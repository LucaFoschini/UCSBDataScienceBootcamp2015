# Linear Algebra and Graphs

## Goal:
The goal of the course is to introduce fundamental concepts of linear algebra
with applications to graph theory.

  * Matrix arithmetic (addition, multiplication)
  * Inversion and Linear Systems (LU, existence and uniqueness of solutions)
  * Vector spaces (definitions, fundamental subspaces, linear independence, basis, rank)
  * Angles, lengths, projection
  * Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, their localization and computation, eigendecomposition, SVD

* Linear Algebra and Graphs
  * Graphs: definitions, properties, representation
  * Spectral graph theory
    - Spectrum of adjacency matrix
    - Laplacians and graph partitioning
