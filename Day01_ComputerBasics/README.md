# Computer Basics

The goal of this module is to gain familiarity with the Unix terminal, the concept of version control, and Jupyter (née IPython) notebooks. After this module you will have a basic understanding of the Unix terminal; understand the importance of version control and be familiar with Github; and have opened and started working in your own Jupyter notebook.

## Outline:
  - Unix Basics
    - How to open and use the terminal
    - How to connect to Unix servers (ssh)
    - Text manipulation and command-line magic
  - Git
    - The importance of version control
    - Github, reproducibility and the scientific method
  - Python and Jupyter notebooks
    - Introduction to Python 
    - Jupyter (née IPython) notebooks 
    - Will be used throughout rest of the bootcamp 

## Getting started

To get started on this section, read through and follow the instructions in the notebooks under the 'notebooks' directory in the numbered order. This section is loosely structured and we encourage you to work in pairs, to explore the various resources linked, and in general get a personal feel for the material for today.
