# Announcements:
  - Lunch with Prof. Alberto Busetto (ECE) at 12noon
  - Afternoon class (Introduction to Graph Algorithms) starts at 1.30pm
  - Take some time at the end of hte day to take the daily survey
  
# Goals

- Learn about complexity classes, efficient algorithms
- Learn about basic data structures
- Identify hard problems and provide approximated solutions.

## Before you Begin
  - Commit your code locally
  - do a ```git pull```

## Intro
 
  - Why are we where today? [Computational thinking as your guiding spirit](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15110-s13/Wing06-ct.pdf)
  - Supercharge your productivity! [Efficiency is key](http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2013/09/29/the-10x-developer-is-not-myth/)
  - Algorithms, [Idioms of modern science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/pubs/algorithm.html)

## Time complexity
  
  - Big-O notation, time complexity examples (O(1), O(logn), O(n)). The importance of constants. 
  - Recursion, recurrences, examples: peak finding, dynamic arrays.
  - Searching: binary, hash tables, pandas indexing, bloom filters
  - Top-k queries, geometric queries.
  - Sorting with examples
  - NP-Hardness, approximation algorithms (example: exponential bucketing). 
  - [Mini Project](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.006/spring11/lectures/lec01.pdf) 

## Beyond:
  - Google coding interviews
  - Programming contests IPSC/ACM Collegiate Programming/IOI
  - Algorithmic resources: [Introduction to Algorithms](http://www.mif.vu.lt/~valdas/ALGORITMAI/LITERATURA/Cormen/Cormen.pdf)
